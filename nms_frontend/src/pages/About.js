								<h2>Why we started AyurAura</h2>
							</div>
							<div className={styles.col1_para}>
								<p>AyurAura was formed with the idea to help people pause and breathe in some peace in their busy city lives. When Siddhant returned back to India after finishing his degree in Landscape Architecture at Cal Tech, he noticed the disconnect between people and nature and decided to start Ugaoo to build a bridge between the two.
								</p>

								<p>
									Rooted firmly in his familyâ€™s century old agri-tech business, Ugaoo sprung up like a new leaf on a spring morning and is today a mighty tree that helps other smaller businesses thrive in its shade. We have formed a proudly Made in India ecosystem that grows with each passing day.
